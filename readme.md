A silly website to showcase silly shaders

todo (high priority stuff):
- Shaders should persist upon texture change when it has not been deselected
- Shader config + reworking config management system
- Halftone/comic book shader :))))

bugs and low priority stuff:
- Insert image needs error handling.
- PerlinTexture should have billowRidge style.
- Texture config interfaces are not needed, and config values are weird in the constructor.
- Clean up render() in ShaderObject.

big picture plans:
- whole ass UI overhaul

other wonderful ideas:
- Config HTML should be automatically generated and maintained.
