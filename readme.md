A silly website to showcase silly shaders

todo (high priority stuff):
- whole ass UI overhaul
- Shader config + reworking config management system

- Insert image needs error handling.
- Texture config interfaces are not needed, and config values are weird in the constructor.
- Clean up render() in ShaderObject.
- dataUrl is never up never up to date for some reason, i think..

other wonderful ideas:
